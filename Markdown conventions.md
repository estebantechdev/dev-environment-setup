# Markdown conventions used in this documentation

`<br />` : Used in the beginning of sentences, it allows to us to replace multiple lines at a time.
<br />`+` is used for the Content at the beginning of topics to create ordered/unordered lists.
<br />`"Backticks"`. A pair of them or 3 consecutive pairs of them are used to highlight keyboard keys, shell commands, code and logs, and words to type in. 
<br />`** **` is used to apply bold face format on keyboard shortcuts actions, important words that are not using "backticks", on directory paths, and on files.
<br />`Uppercased characters` are also used to highlight important words.
<br /> `>`, that indents for embedded text, is used to list subsection topics, instead of the use of `+`.
<br />`-` is used to list dotted points.

`* *`, to use italic formats on quoted words or kind of "dialogs" and text is not in use.
<br />`*** ***`, which applies italic + bold face formatting on words is not in use.

Consolidate Changes from Original Repository

Summary:
- Modified README.md to fix typographical errors and update references from "Picone" to "Pinecone".
- Added configurations for sentiment analysis and chatroom paragraph formatting in User's Guide.md.
- Updated JSON file to reflect current request and response statuses.
- Removed redundant and outdated documentation and licensing files for the "Picone" implementation.




chore: Remove redundant Pinecone index creation scripts and examples

- Deleted `create_and_configure_a_new_pinecone_index.py`, which included initial code for creating a new Pinecone index.
- Removed `create_and_configure_pinecone_index.py`, which had an alternate version of the Pinecone index creation script.
- Deleted `create_embeddings_and_upsert_data.py`, which contained code for creating embeddings and upserting data into Pinecone.
- Removed `examples/README.md`, which provided instructions for running an example implementation of the commbase-genai-slm-ollama-phi3-mini-memory-remote-rag-picone project.

These files were redundant and have been consolidated or moved to more appropriate locations within the project structure.




git commit -m "Remove deprecated file paths and utility functions for Phi3 model.

Deleted 'file_paths.py' and 'functions.py' from the 'commbase-genai-slm-ollama-phi3-mini-memory-remote-rag-picone' bundle. These files contained functions for managing file paths and utility functions for various tasks, which are now obsolete and no longer needed in the project.

Key changes:
- Removed functions for retrieving values from configuration files.
- Removed functions for handling chat participant names, logging settings, and file paths.
- Removed test embedding model setup using the MiniLM-L6 sentence transformer model.

These deletions streamline the codebase, removing outdated functionalities and dependencies."



git commit -m "Remove legacy Python scripts and chat logs

- Deleted load_a_dataset_with_pandas.py: Script for loading and printing dataset information using pandas.
- Deleted making_queries.py: Script for creating and executing queries using Pinecone and sentence_transformers.
- Deleted chat_log_20240609203647_4314.txt and chat_log_20240609220435_18072.txt: Logs of interactions with the assistant Eva AI from June 9, 2024.

Reason: Cleanup of outdated and unused scripts and logs to maintain codebase hygiene and reduce clutter."



git commit -m "Remove deprecated script for chat files processing

Deleted the script 'save_chat_files_as_json_dataset.py' which was responsible for automating the processing of raw chat log files into a structured JSON dataset. This script performed text cleaning, content chunking, and dataset augmentation, ensuring data integrity and format consistency throughout the transformation process. The script is no longer needed due to updates in our data processing pipeline.

- Deleted unnecessary script `save_chat_files_as_json_dataset.py`:
  - Automated processing of chat logs into JSON
  - Text cleaning and content chunking
  - Data augmentation with additional fields
  - Handled multiple chat files, ensuring data integrity and consistency
  - Removed emojis and empty entries
  - Generated structured datasets with unique IDs and additional 'content' fields

The removal of this script is part of the ongoing effort to streamline and modernize our codebase, eliminating outdated and redundant code components."




Update README and remove commbase-genai-slm-ollama-phi3-mini-memory.py

- README.md: Updated the title and description to reflect the new project name `commbase-genai-slm-ollama-phi3-mini-memory`. The new description provides a clear explanation of the project's functionality, which includes generating AI-driven responses using the Ollama API with the `commbase-phi3-mini` model from Microsoft, enhanced with session memory for better contextual relevance.
- Removed commbase-genai-slm-ollama-phi3-mini-memory.py: This script was deleted as part of the refactoring process. The script previously managed chat memory and generated AI responses using the Ollama API with the `commbase-phi3-mini` model.

      - Updated docstring for clarity on sentiment analysis and hardware notification actions.

    - **Updated `text_to_speech()`**:
      - Added `returned_total_paragraphs` parameter to accommodate the new functionality in `main()`.

    - **Enhanced `main()` Function**:
      - Added logic to handle large responses by checking word count and notifying hardware for neutral sentiment.

Reflect changes made to an original Git repository in a copy repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Backup the copy repo
-----------------------

Example:
Original repo: https://github.com/estebanways/commbase
Copy repo: https://github.com/mydroidandi/commbase

Practice the following in both repositories before copy them:

```shell
git status
git pull origin fb/estebanways
```

Or, depending on your branches

```shell
git pull origin main
```

- Remove all the directories and files except .git/ in the copy repo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the repo directory properties include number of files and content size.

For example:
242.5 MiB (254,269,288)
3,378 files, 384 sub-folders

You can use the script detailed-directory-info.sh to retrieve that information.

- Paste a copy of the content, except .git/ from the original repo to the copy repo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In the copy repo
-------------------

```shell

git diff > tmp_diff.txt
```

Paste the file to the directory: Reflect changes made to an original Git repository in a copy repository.

- Select pieces of text to paste in ChatGPT
--------------------------------------------

Consolidate results in a single text tmp_diff_consolidated.txt

Using this advice:

To describe the changes in just one commit in the copy repository, you can follow these steps:

Summarize the Changes: Provide a brief overview of the changes made in this commit. Mention that it includes modifications, new files, files moved, and files deleted.
List Modifications: Enumerate the modifications made to existing files. Briefly describe the nature of each modification (e.g., bug fix, feature enhancement, code refactoring).
Identify New Files: List the new files added to the repository and briefly describe their purpose or functionality.
Note File Movements: Highlight any files that were moved within the repository, along with the reasons for the movement if applicable.
Acknowledge Deleted Files: Mention any files that were deleted from the repository and explain the rationale behind their removal, if necessary.
Provide Context (Optional): If there are specific reasons behind some of the changes (e.g., to address a bug, implement a new feature, or improve code structure), briefly explain them.
Conclusion: Conclude the commit message with a summary statement reiterating the overall purpose of the changes and any significant outcomes expected.

Summary:
Consolidating Changes from Original Repository

Details:
- Modified 25 files to address various bugs and improve code efficiency.
- Added 15 new files to implement additional features and enhance functionality.
- Moved 5 files to reorganize project structure and improve maintainability.
- Deleted 2 redundant files to streamline the repository.

Context:
This commit represents a consolidation of changes from the original repository, encompassing a total of 47 modifications, additions, movements, and deletions. These changes aim to enhance the overall stability, functionality, and organization of the codebase.

Create a Git commit content using the next summary of the result of the command git diff:

PASTE PIECE OF GIT DIFF HERE ...

To avoid repeating pasting everything, prompt ChatGPT:

Using the previous advice, Create a Git commit content using the next summary of the result of the following section of my git diff command:

PASTE ANOTHER PIECE OF GIT DIFF HERE ...

- Organize the consolidated content in a new file tmp_commit.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Sections:

Title:
------

Repository Refactoring and Feature Enhancements: Consolidated Changes

Or, relies on the case:

Consolidating Changes: Modifications, Additions, Movements, and Deletions

Consolidating Changes from Original Repository

### Changes made in this repository

(
To get the commits list:

In the copy repo, to obtain the day of the last pasted copy:

```shell
git log
```

In the original repo, use the date, example, for May 08, so the output includes commits starting from May 08, after 02:20:01:

To get the commits list without hashes:

```shell
git log --after="2024-05-08T02:20:01" --pretty=oneline --decorate | cut -d ' ' -f 2- > tmp_commits_no_hashes.txt

```
Using cut command (removes everything before the first space.)

Remember to clean up the content of the file (you can use ChatGPT.)

Prompts for ChatGPT:

Remove the duplicate lines from the following text list. Add a:
-
to every line

PASTE THE CONTENT OF tmp_commits_no_hashes.txt HERE ...

Add the results to the current section.

)

### Changes by file

(
Prompt ChatGPT to Summarize the changes by file, using:

1. The new content of the file tmp_diff_consolidated.txt.
2. It is supposed that we are yet in the same ChatGPT conversation so it remembers the previous git diff made.
3. If you find mistakes or missing information at this point, you can compare any file version in the copy repository like this:

```shell
git diff bundles/commbase-stt-whisper-proactive-p/commbase_stt_whisper_proactive_p.py
```

)

### Deleted Files

(
In the copy repository:

```shell
git status | grep deleted
```
)

### New files

(
In the copy repository, copy the list of untracked files:

```shell
git status
```
)

### Conclusion

(
Prompt ChatGPT for a conclusion based on the content of the section: ### Changes made in this repository

Prompt:
Draw a conclusion based on the next information ...
)

- Summarize the list using the new content of tmp_commit.txt, save it in tmp_updates.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save the summary in tmp_updates.txt

Use titles like:

### Enhancing Commbase: A Comprehensive Overview

or:

### Summary of Consolidating Changes in Commbase Repository

If the summary is too big, keep only a list of the most significant/remarkable one (This will be used later on in the PULL REQUEST in the copy repo.)

Prompts for ChatGPT:
Make a summary using
-
for every statement, based on the most important information about the changes made from the next text (don't exceed the number of 13 sentences):

TEXT HERE

The verbs use should end in ing or ed, for example:

Changes made:
[OK] Deleted redundant and deprecated files related to skill parsing and running.
[WRONG] Reflect variable changes and updates in user documentation for clarity.
[OK] Enhanced hardware integration by adding functions for communicating STT statuses.

I can prompt ChatGPT:
Just modify the sentences of the list to use present continuous tense instead of past tense.

Changes made:
The changes made in this update include:

[OK] Cleaning up the codebase by removing old comments, fixing comments, and changing verbs for clarity.
[OK] Adding new scripts for internationalization purposes.
[OK] Adding new files to manage the conversations directory.

- Commit using the content of tmp_commit.txt to the copy repository on local and push changes on GitHub.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```shell
# Make sure you checked out your feature branch
git branch -a
git checkout fb/estebanways
git add .
git commit -m "Title in tmp_commit.txt" -m "`Content in tmp_commit.txt`"
git push origin fb/estebanways
```

In the pull request to merge on the development/main branch, add the content of tmp_updates.txt as a pull request comment.

It should have title and content, for example:

Title:
(Prefer to leave the existent title, when it says the branch of the pull request, for example feature/estebanawys or Development. Otherwise, you can use something like: "Consolidating Changes: Enhancing Commbase Functionality")

Content:

Title:
### Enhancing Commbase: A Comprehensive Overview

- Resolving issues with pane display, optimizing code, and removing redundant variables.
- Introducing a new configuration variable for benchmarking speech processing time.
(...)

- Backdrop build.com update or ship text field version
-------------------------------------------------------

Use the following title and structure in the field:

Summary of Shipped Updates:

- point 1
- point 2
- point 3

For an alternative version of the update for a CEO or non technical, you can ask ChatGPT:

Create a version of this text for a presentation to a CEO:

PASTE HERE THE CONTENT OF tmp_updates.txt

-- **ASSISTANT_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVELS_ON**:
-  - Description: This variable determines whether the logging severity levels are enabled/disabled within the assistant's messages in the chatroom. The Log Severity Levels are used in software development and system administration to categorize the severity of events being logged. By utilizing these levels effectively, you can streamline the debugging process, improve system monitoring, and enhance the overall stability of your scripts. Assistant messages are called **discourses** in Commbase. Based on the nature of these messages, they generally fall into the informational category, hence the majority being classified as **INFO**. Instructions might sometimes warrant a **WARNING** level, especially if they are crucial and require attention. The next is a guide to log your assistant discourses appropriately, matching type of discourse and log severity level: 1. Answers: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 2. Greetings: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 3. Instructions: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_3 (WARNING), 4. Introductions: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 5. Jokes: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 6. Phrases: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 7. Questions: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 8. Quotations: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 9. Speeches: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 10. Statements: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO), 11. Talks: LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2 (INFO). Don't forget to tailor the log messages to provide relevant details about scripts execution. Here's the default list of log level variables in the configuration file **/config/commbase.conf**: `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_1`, `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2`, `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_3`, `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_4`, `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_5`, `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_6`, `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_7`.
+  - Description: It specifies whether the assistant discourses are spoken out loud or not.
   - Possible values:
-    - `True` (Default): Set to True, the assistant includes the log severity level in its chatroom messages.
-    - `False`: Set to False, the assistant does not include the log severity level in its chatroom messages.
+    - `True` (Default): Set to True, the assistant speaks messages out loud.
+    - `False`: Set to False, the assistant doesn't speak messages out loud.
 
 - **LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_1**:
-  - Description: It is used for detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems.
+  - Description: It is used for detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems. For logging all AI assistant voice speeches, you would typically use a lower severity log level because these events are routine and not indicative of any issues. That is why we use **DEBUG** when printing logs with assistant discourses in the chatroom pane. Severity Levels are used in software development and system administration to categorize the severity of events being logged. By utilizing these levels effectively, you can streamline the debugging process, improve system monitoring, and enhance the overall stability of your scripts. The appropriate severity levels for this purpose would be: `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_1` = "DEBUG": This level is suitable for detailed information that is mainly useful for developers when diagnosing problems. `LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL_2` = "INFO": This level is appropriate for informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a coarse-grained level. Assistant discourses can be: 1. Answers, 2. Greetings, 3. Instructions, 4. Introductions, 5. Jokes, 6. Phrases, 7. Questions, 8. Quotations, 9. Speeches, 10. Statements, or 11. Talks.

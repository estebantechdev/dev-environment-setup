Refactor and enhance commbase STT whisper functionality

- Added `datetime` import to include timestamps in logs.
- Replaced `get_assistant_log_severity_levels_on` and `get_log_severity_level_2` with `get_log_severity_level_1`.
- Introduced timestamps and standardized log format in `write_to_temp_file`.
- Modified `get_chat_log_file` to append a slash before the file path value.
- Removed `get_assistant_log_severity_levels_on` function from `functions.py`.
- Renamed `get_log_severity_level_2` to `get_log_severity_level_1` and updated its usage.
- Added functions to notify hardware about processing start and stop in `commbase_stt_whisper_reactive_p.py`.
- Included `subprocess` import for hardware notifications.
- Integrated hardware notification functions in the main processing loop.
- Added processing time visibility feature with elapsed time calculation in `commbase_stt_whisper_reactive_p.py`.
- Updated binary file `recording.wav`.

These changes improve logging consistency, enhance hardware interaction, and provide better visibility into processing times.



Added file_paths.py:
- Fixed the path construction in the get_chat_log_file function to properly append a slash between the directory and file name.
- Added functions to retrieve the paths for hardware command processing start and stop files, and hardware device 0.
- These functions parse the configuration file to retrieve the specified paths.
- Updated functions.py:
  - Added functions to retrieve the status of hardware notifications and processing start and stop notifications.
  - These functions read the corresponding variables from the environment configuration file.
  - Added a function to determine if the processing time should be visible.
  - This function retrieves the value of the STT_ENGINE_PROCESSING_TIME_VISIBLE_ON variable from the environment configuration file.



  Summary:
- Added a timestamp variable to store the current date and time.
- Modified the logging process to include the timestamp in the log messages.
- Removed redundant conditional blocks for logging severity levels.
- Updated the function call to `assistant_discourse` with the appropriate arguments.

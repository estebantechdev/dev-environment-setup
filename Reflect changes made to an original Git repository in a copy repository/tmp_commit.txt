- Give the file execution permissions
- Manage to automatically start recording when the recorder device is available after pressing the recording char key just one time
- Calculate and display the processing time in the reactive stt engine
- Change the STT_ENGINE_PROCESSING_TIME_VISIBLE_ON variable value to True to be able to calculate and display the processing time in the reactive stt engine
- Create optional serial hardware interaction with the reactive stt engine
- Add serial hardware related proactive stt engine file paths and functions to reactive stt engine
- Enable COMMBASE_HARDWARE_NOTIFICATIONS_ON to create serial hardware interaction with the reactive stt engine
- Add a new option --show-full-commbase-log to display the full Commbase log in the apps pane
- Add new file bundles/libcommbase/libcommbase/routines/assistant_discourse_with_external_capture_driving.sh

How can I create my own wikipedia page?

###### ChatGPT said:

Creating your own Wikipedia page is possible — but **it’s tricky**. Wikipedia has **strict guidelines** to prevent self-promotion and ensure neutrality. Here’s a step-by-step guide so you can do it correctly (and with the best chance of the page staying up):

* * *

### ⚙️ Step 1: Understand Wikipedia’s Notability Rules

Wikipedia only accepts pages about **notable** people, companies, or works — meaning:

*   You (or the subject) must have **significant coverage in reliable, independent sources** (e.g., national newspapers, magazines, books, academic papers).
    
*   Mentions in social media, personal blogs, or press releases **don’t count**.
    
*   Awards, major collaborations, or leadership roles in recognized organizations help establish notability.
    

If you have features in places like _La Nación_, _Radio Universidad de Costa Rica_, or _Diario La República_, those might qualify — especially if the articles discuss your career or achievements in depth.

* * *

### 🧾 Step 2: Gather Reliable Sources

Before writing anything, collect:

*   **At least 3–5 independent** media articles (not interviews or paid pieces).
    
*   Any **official records** of awards, honors, or public recognition.
    
*   **Books** or academic papers mentioning your work.
    

You’ll need to cite these sources directly in the article.

* * *

### ✍️ Step 3: Create a Wikipedia Account

1.  Go to [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
    
2.  Create an account (optional but highly recommended — unregistered users can’t create new pages easily).
    
3.  Once logged in, click your user icon → “**Sandbox**” — this is your private draft area.
    

* * *

### 🧱 Step 4: Draft the Page in Your Sandbox

Write a **neutral, third-person biography**, following the format of similar Wikipedia articles.  
Basic structure:

text

`== Early life and education == == Career == == Awards and recognition == == Personal life (optional) == == References == == External links ==`

Keep the tone factual — **no promotional language**.  
For example, write:

> Esteban Herrera is a Costa Rican actor, communicator, and software development consultant. He has worked with media outlets such as Radio Nacional and Diario La Nación.

Not:

> Esteban Herrera is a brilliant and influential figure in modern communication.

* * *

### 🔍 Step 5: Add Citations

Every major claim needs a reference:

wiki

`Herrera received the National Award in Film in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=National Film Awards 2012 |url=https://... |work=La Nación |date=2012-07-15}}</ref>`

You can use the **“Cite”** button in the Wikipedia editor — it handles the formatting.

* * *

### 🧩 Step 6: Submit for Review

Once your draft is ready:

1.  Move it from the Sandbox to **Articles for Creation (AfC)**.
    
2.  A volunteer editor will review it — this can take days or weeks.
    
3.  If accepted, it becomes a live Wikipedia article.
    

If rejected, the editor will explain why (usually lack of notability or neutrality), and you can fix and resubmit.

* * *

### ⚠️ Step 7: Avoid Conflicts of Interest

Wikipedia discourages **writing about yourself**. You can:

*   Disclose your connection on the Talk page (“I’m the subject of this article”).
    
*   Ask an **experienced editor** or **WikiProject Biography** member to draft it on your behalf — that often increases credibility.
    

* * *

### ✅ Optional Tip

If you have your own website or blog, you can create a **“press” page** that organizes your references (articles, awards, etc.). It helps editors verify sources quickly.

* * *

Would you like me to show you a **sample Wikipedia draft** for your profile (formatted correctly with sections, tone, and placeholders for sources)?  
That would make it much easier to get started and adapt later.

Perfect — here’s a **sample Wikipedia draft** for your profile, written in neutral encyclopedic tone and formatted to match Wikipedia standards.  
You can paste this directly into your **Wikipedia Sandbox** and replace the `[citation needed]` and `<ref>` placeholders with real sources (articles, awards, interviews, etc.).

2.  Replace every `[citation needed]` and fake URL (`example.com`) with **real references**.
    
3.  Use the **Preview** button to check formatting before saving.

Would you like me to:

*   ✅ Tailor the draft with your **exact award year**, real **media references**, and verified **project details** (like Commbase and your film background)?  
    That would make it nearly **publication-ready** for Wikipedia.

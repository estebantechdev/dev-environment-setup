While Docker Desktop itself provides a graphical user interface for managing Docker, it is not a web-based interface. For a free web-based management interface for Docker, including Docker Compose projects, several open-source options are available:

Portainer: A widely used and popular lightweight management UI for Docker environments. It offers a comprehensive set of features for managing containers, images, networks, volumes, and supports Docker Compose.

Dockge: A free and open-source web UI specifically designed for managing Docker Compose projects, particularly in home lab environments. It provides features like deploying new projects, managing existing ones, accessing container shells and logs, and an interactive compose file generator.

Arcane: Arcane is a lightweight, open-source alternative to Portainer and Dockge, designed to make Docker management simple and beautiful — without sacrificing functionality.

Komodo: A free and open-source container management tool that offers features similar to Portainer, including pulling and building images, deploying stacks, and creating automations for CI/CD pipelines. It can manage multiple Docker servers and integrate with platforms like GitHub.

Rancher Desktop: An open-source desktop application that provides a local Kubernetes and container management solution, including support for Docker and other container runtimes. It offers a graphical interface for managing containers and Kubernetes clusters.

These tools offer varying levels of functionality and cater to different use cases, from simple container management to complex CI/CD workflows and Kubernetes integration. The choice of tool depends on specific needs and preferences.

With this separation, you can run the server and client code independently.

Run the Server:

```shell
npx ts-node server.ts
```

This command starts the Express server.

Run the Client:

```shell
npx ts-node client.ts

```

This command runs the client code that makes a request to the server.

Make sure to install axios if you haven't already:

```shell
npm install axios
```
